CAD files of the paper "Quadcopters Testing Platform for Educational Environments", by U. Veyna, S. Garcia-Nieto, R. Simarro and J.V. Salcedo.
The design for its development is described in detail in the following paper: https://doi.org/10.3390/s21124134.

In this repository you will find the following folders:

/3D Printing Parts: This folder contains the files of the parts that are manufactured by 3D printing.

/CAD Prototype: This folder contains the CAD model for the prototype assembly with all its elements. In particular, the following files are emphasized:

- The file "Assembly_gyro_ring_without_dron" shows the assembly of the test platform without the quadcopter.

- The file "Gyro_ring_assembly" shows the main ring assembled by the 3D printing parts.

- The file "Gyro_ring_assembly_with_dron" shows the assembly of the test platform and the coupling with the quadcopter.
